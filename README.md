# RSA-Encryption Program description
Python program that replicates the RSA encryption algorithm. User inputs certain prime numbers and a number (1-256) and a secret message. The message is then encrypted using RSA encryption.

# What i learnt from this project
- A secure method of encryption
- Identifying prime numbers in a set of numbers.
- BITWISE operations
- Carmichaelâ€™s totient function
